Be sensible about packing and choosing items for the trip. The stereotype of a tourist with a huge backpack is long gone. Thanks to the technological development of the gear market, experienced modern tourists can confidently embark on a week-long hike with a backpack weighing no more than 7-10 kilograms! This can be achieved by prioritizing the most versatile and lightweight gear, not taking heaps of unnecessary clothes, dishes, etc. However, this does not mean neglecting comfort and safety!"
